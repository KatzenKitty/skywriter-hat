This repository contains libraries and examples for the Skywriter boards.

Installing Software
===================

You can usually use our quick-n-easy installer to get Skywriter up and running on a Pi. Type the following into a terminal on your Raspberry Pi, use LXTerminal if you're looking at the desktop:

```
curl -sSL get.pimoroni.com/skywriter | bash
```

For full instructions on installing Skywriter, check out [the library README file](/python/library/README.md).
